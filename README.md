# CBSD68-dataset
Color BSD68 dataset for image denoising benchmarks

This benchmark dataset is widely used for measuring image denoising algorithms performance, however I could not find it easily.
It includes the original .jpg files, converted to lossless .png, and noisy with Additive White Gaussian Noise of different levels.
